I'm using this to learn Python. I've tried before.

I was not a big fan at the start, but it's a good language to know. I'm still not a big fan, but I don't completely hate it. Progress!

## Day 13
### December 19, 2020
My answer is horribly inefficient. I increment the testing value by the largest bus number in the list, and test forward and backward from it, so I'm incrementing by the smallest immediately available number, but there's got to be a better way. To make it quicker, I used an extremely dumb hack by literally just starting near 100 trillion. 

As of writing this, however, it's nearing 4AM so I should rest. I left the program running, and there's a timer hooked up to it, so if it finishes overnight, then hey, it finishes overnight.

## Day 12
### December 19, 2020
This is an organizational day! Also, I love dictionaries. The problem was nice and simple, especially compared to the last two.

- I finally created a template to make starting these puzzles quicker. 
- Renamed func.py to helper.py.

## Day 11
### December 18, 2020
Having so much bounds checking makes messy code. There's got to be a better way to do it. 2D arrays are difficult to use in this language. Some googling has introduced me to numpy, but I haven't used it for this problem. I should, the next time I need to play with matrices.

Here's some gripes: Why are strings immutable? Also, why isn't "else if" a statement that you can use? For a language that's supposed to naturally create nice looking code, the fact that else ifs push the indentation back and the fact that there's no switch statements is just... horrible.

I do, however, appreciate the fact that you can do multiple returns through a k-tuple.
## Day 10
### December 17, 2020
Fell behind again. This day was a doozy, took me nearly four hours. I learned about list comprehensions (though I didn't end up using them) and dictionaries. Complex problem with a nice, simple answer.

## Day 9
### December 14, 2020
I said I'd stop for the day but I guess I lied. Finally installed a ruler in VSC, so my comments should be a lot more consistent.

## Day 8
### December 14, 2020
This was a fun one. Last year I had trouble creating the machine, but this year's going much smoother. I'm starting to appreciate Python's simplicity. There's some repitition in the solution outside the actual machine, but it works so I'm leaving it as is.

## Day 7
### December 14, 2020
Finally got introduced to objects, though I feel like I need to conceptualize them less like objects and more like structures. The fact I have to put self.x within objects is annoying. Working on a graph problem was nice, though I don't think my solution is the most efficient.

## Day 6
### December 14, 2020
Haven't done these in a while so I'm gonna have to pump them out. This day's not bad. Discovered the set() and list() methods.

## Day 5
### December 5, 2020
Disappointed that Python doesn't have switch statements and arrays. I have to stop thinking of these programs in Java terms and start thinking more like I'm using Prolog or Haskell. I can see how it fits a niche, but it's definitely not a language I'm going to be using for large projects.

## Day 4
### December 4, 2020
Things are getting more complex. Fighting the syntax. Created a module for list ~~functions~~ methods. Discovered the regular expression library.

## Day 3
### December 3, 2020
Started creating functions from scratch, learned about enumerate(). Considering making a library.

## Day 2
### December 2, 2020
Getting more comfortable with string functions.

## Day 1
### December 1, 2020
Used a read_integers function found online to create a list from the input, not fully understanding lists and functions in this language yet.
