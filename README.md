I'm using this to learn Python, basically from scratch.

- Day 1: Used a read_integers function found online to create a list, not fully understanding lists and functions in this language yet.
- Day 2: Getting more comfortable with string functions.
- Day 3: Started creating functions from scratch, learned about enumerate(). Considering making a library at this point.
