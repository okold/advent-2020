I'm using this to learn Python, basically from scratch.

- Day 1: Used a read_integers function found online to create a list from the input, not fully understanding lists and functions in this language yet.
- Day 2: Getting more comfortable with string functions.
- Day 3: Started creating functions from scratch, learned about enumerate(). Considering making a library.
- Day 4: Things are getting more complex. Fighting the syntax. Created a module for list ~~functions~~ methods. Discovered the regular expression library.
- Day 5: Disappointed that Python doesn't have switch statements and arrays. I have to stop thinking of these programs in Java terms and start thinking more like I'm using Prolog or Haskell. I can see how it fits a niche, but it's definitely not a language I'm going to be using for large projects.
- Day 6: Haven't done these in a while so I'm gonna have to pump them out. This day's not bad. Discovered the set() and list() methods.
- Day 7: Finally got introduced to objects, though I feel like I need to conceptualize them less like objects and more like structures. The fact I have to put self.x within objects is annoying. Working on a graph problem was nice, though I don't think my solution is the most efficient.
- Day 8: This was a fun one. Last year I had trouble creating the machine, but this year's going much smoother. I'm starting to appreciate Python's simplicity. There's some repition in the solution outside the actual machine, but it works so I'm leaving it as is.
